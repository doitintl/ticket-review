## Executive Summary

In today's fast-paced customer service environment, continuous improvement is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and agent performance. Our proposal outlines the development and implementation of a Ticket Review Tool aimed at optimizing ticket handling processes, improving customer experience, and facilitating knowledge sharing among CREs. Ticket reviews are an essential requirement for any Cloud Architect, [especially for IC5 & IC6](https://doitintl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CRE/pages/237142038/Individual+Contributor+Track#IC5---Sr.-Cloud-Architect-II-(Sr.-Cloud-Architect)).

## Motivation

The Ticket Review Tool is designed to address several key objectives:

1. **CRE Upskilling and Training:** Provide opportunities for CRE upskilling and training through the analysis of ticket interactions.
2. **Identification of Asset Cases:** Identify tickets that serve as valuable assets such as playbooks, case studies, etc.
3. **Improvement of Customer Experience:** Enhance the overall customer experience by identifying areas for improvement based on ticket reviews.
4. **Learning from Tickets:** Extract insights from tickets to understand best practices, areas for improvement, and opportunities for deflection. Identify cases which represent DoiTs values such as "wow-the-customer", "see-it-through", and "act-as-one-team".
5. **Promotion of Blameless Culture:** Foster a blameless culture by providing constructive feedback and insights rather than assigning blame.

## Key Features

1. **Standardized Review Criteria Definition (TBD):**
   - Quality and validity of the responses provided by the CRE.
   - Timeliness of Response.
   - Inference of the degree of complexity.

2. **Reviewer Selection:**
   - Allow for peer group or focus area-based ticket reviews to ensure relevance and expertise.
   - Rotate reviewers periodically to provide diverse perspectives.

3. **Anonymized Reviews:**
   - Ensure non-biased and anonymized reviews to maintain objectivity.

4. **Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Provide options for reviewers to leave comments, give thumbs up, add tags, or complete checklists based on predefined review criteria.

## Potential Features

5. **Sentiment Analysis for Each Ticket**
6. **Automated Pre-filled Review (Based on Manually Reviewed Ticket History Using an LLM)**

### Deliverables

- A process & definition of what a good review needs to be.
- A user-friendly and efficient platform for conducting structured ticket reviews that integrates well with Zendesk ticket data.
- Comprehensive training material for CREs.
